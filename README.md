Hi, I'm Garrett and I'm an aspiring technical artist/graphics engine developer. 

Let me show you what you've been missing.

ðŸ’¬ Now:
- Optimizing GPU instanced grass with culling and LOD calculated with compute shaders.

ðŸ’­ Later:
- Look into weather effects.

ðŸ’¤ Previously:
- Made a [video game](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/The-Dating-Game) for Ludwig Jam.
- Made a video on level of detail and geometry shader triangle culling.
- Implemented an [old grass rendering technique](https://youtu.be/Y0Ko0kvwfgA).
- Implemented a [more modern looking grass that](https://youtu.be/jw00MbIJcrk) uses real geometry.
