Hi, I'm Garrett and I like making pretty images with code. 

Let me show you what you've been missing.

ðŸ’¬ Now:
- Learning environmental design and texturing for my game Macroscopic.
- Investigating noise and creating interesting randomly generated landscapes for environment inspiration.
- Improving my python skills and learning pyQT due to GUI development contract work.
- Writing my own [image effect](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/Image-Effects) shaders for contrast, brightness, multiply, etc.

ðŸ’­ Later:
- Investigate how one dimensional noise can create a convincing heavy rain effect.
- Learn about advanced particle systems with compute shaders like those from The Last Of Us 2.
- Read about how best to implement foliage in games, whether it's with gpu instancing or not.
- Implement realistic snow mesh deformation in Macroscopic.
- Read about how weather effects are created in video games.

ðŸ’¤ Previously:
- Learned how compute shaders work with a [GPU driven ray tracer](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/Compute-Ray-Tracer) and [Conway's game of life](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/Compute-Game-Of-Life).
- Learned numerous basic graphics techniques such as parallax mapping.
- Learned the basics of Unity's shader language.
- Enjoyed the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/) event. You can find my solutions for every problem [here](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/Advent-Of-Code-2020).
