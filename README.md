Hi, I'm Garrett and I'm an aspiring technical artist/graphics engine developer. 

Let me show you what you've been missing.

ðŸ’¬ Now:
- Learning environmental design and texturing for my game Macroscopic.
- Learning about fluid dynamics and the Navier-Stokes equations for my own fluid simulation explorations.
- Writing firmware for the Watchy, an open source E-ink watch.

ðŸ’­ Later:
- Implement realistic snow mesh deformation in Macroscopic.
- Read about how weather effects are created in video games.
- Create various foliage shaders.

ðŸ’¤ Previously:
- Wrote my own [post processing](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/Image-Effects) shaders, including a compute shader approach to bayer dithering.
- Wrote my own [Minecraft shaders](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/Minecraft-Shaders) and created a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSS5HuSr4SQ) going over the effects used.
- Created a [Twitch bot](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/Acerola_Bot) that scans the chat for backseat gaming.
