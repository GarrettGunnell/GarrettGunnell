Hi, I'm Garrett and I'm a technical artist/graphics developer. 

Let me show you what you've been missing.

ðŸ’¬ Now:
- Reading about shell texturing.

ðŸ’­ Later:
- Look into weather effects.
- Explore compute particle systems for Unity.
- Implement all currently relevant anti aliasing techniques. 

ðŸ’¤ Previously:
- Tried to recreate Counter Strike 2's smoke grenades.
- Implemented simple sum of sines fluid simulation and inverse fast fourier transform ocean simulation.
- Made a basic random color palette generator to demonstrate color space differences.
