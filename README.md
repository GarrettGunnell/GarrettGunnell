Hi, I'm Garrett and I'm an aspiring technical artist/graphics engine developer. 

Let me show you what you've been missing.

ðŸ’¬ Now:
- Learning environmental design and texturing for my game Macroscopic.
- Learning about fluid dynamics and the Navier-Stokes equations for my own fluid simulation explorations.
- Writing firmware for the Watchy, an open source E-ink watch.

ðŸ’­ Later:
- Implement realistic snow mesh deformation in Macroscopic.
- Read about how weather effects are created in video games.
- Create various foliage shaders.

ðŸ’¤ Previously:
- Made a video on chaikin curves which you can watch [here](https://youtu.be/wVgzmFo9SbY).
- Made a video on cellular automata which you can watch [here](https://youtu.be/t_HcBAO_Yas).
- Made a video on pseudo random number generates which you can watch [here](https://youtu.be/PDd5GQnjR44).
- Made a [video game](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/The-Dating-Game) for Ludwig Jam.
