Hi, I'm Garrett and I'm a technical artist/graphics developer. 

Let me show you what you've been missing.

ðŸ’¬ Now:
- Recreating Counter Strike 2's responsive smoke grenades.

ðŸ’­ Later:
- Look into weather effects.
- Explore compute particle systems for Unity.
- Implement all currently relevant anti aliasing techniques. 
- Prototype grainy real time ray tracing as the main aesthetic of a horror game.

ðŸ’¤ Previously:
- Invented a new sdr color filtering method for cinematic depth of field.
- Implemented the extended difference of gaussians for advanced image stylization.
- Implemented chromatic aberration, vignetting, and film grain for film camera aesthetics.
- Tried to invent a real time pixel sorter.
