Hi, I'm Garrett and I'm a technical artist/graphics developer. 

Let me show you what you've been missing.

ðŸ’¬ Now:
- Faking pixel art with post processing effects.

ðŸ’­ Later:
- Look into weather effects.

ðŸ’¤ Previously:
- Recreated Loop Hero's [CRT Shader](https://youtu.be/aWdySZ0BtJs).
- Texture hacked Super Smash Bros Melee and made custom skins for the game.
- Recreated Elden Ring's [eternal city stars](https://youtu.be/IMiiUEG-sLQ).
- Created a tool for testing several [tone mappers](https://youtu.be/wbn5ULLtkHs) in Unity.
