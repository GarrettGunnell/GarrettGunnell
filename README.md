Hi, I'm Garrett and I'm a technical artist/graphics developer. 

Let me show you what you've been missing.

ðŸ’¬ Now:
- Implementing chromatic aberration and some other camera specific effects for a series of shorts.
- Trying to invent a real time pixel sorting shader.

ðŸ’­ Later:
- Look into weather effects.
- Explore compute particle systems for Unity.
- Implement all currently relevant anti aliasing techniques. 
- Prototype grainy real time ray tracing as the main aesthetic of a horror game.

ðŸ’¤ Previously:
- Created a [suite of shaders](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/AcerolaFX) for ReShade to improve the visuals of Final Fantasy XIV.
- Implemented the basic, generalized, and anisotropic Kuwahara Filters to make images look like oil paintings.
- Invented a new sdr color filtering method for cinematic depth of field.
- Implemented the extended difference of gaussians for advanced image stylization.
