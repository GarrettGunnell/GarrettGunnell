Hi, I'm Garrett and I'm an aspiring technical artist/graphics engine developer. 

Let me show you what you've been missing.

ðŸ’¬ Now:
- Learning environmental design and texturing for my game Macroscopic.
- Improving my python skills and learning pyQT with contract work.
- Learning about fluid dynamics and the Navier-Stokes equations for my own fluid simulation explorations.

ðŸ’­ Later:
- Attempt to create a heavy rain effect with one dimensional noise.
- Implement realistic snow mesh deformation in Macroscopic.
- Read about how weather effects are created in video games.

ðŸ’¤ Previously:
- Learned how compute shaders work with a [GPU driven ray tracer](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/Compute-Ray-Tracer) and [Conway's game of life](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/Compute-Game-Of-Life).
- Learned numerous basic rendering techniques such as parallax mapping.
- Enjoyed the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/) event. You can find my solutions for every problem [here](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/Advent-Of-Code-2020).
- Wrote my own [post processing](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/Image-Effects) shaders, including a compute shader approach to bayer dithering.
