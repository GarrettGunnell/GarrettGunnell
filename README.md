Hi, I'm Garrett and I like making pretty images with code. 

Let me show you what you've been missing.

Now:
- Learning environmental design and texturing for my game Macroscopic.
- Investigating noise and creating interesting randomly generated landscapes for environment inspiration.
- Improving my python skills and learning pyQT due to GUI development contract work.
- Enjoying the Advent of Code 2020 event.

Later:
- Investigate how one dimensional noise can create a convincing heavy rain effect.
- Learn about advanced particle systems with compute shaders like those from The Last Of Us 2.
- Read about how best to implement foliage in games, whether it's with gpu instancing or not.
- Implement realistic snow mesh deformation in Macroscopic.
- Read about how weather effects are created in video games.

Previously:
- Learned how compute shaders work with a ray tracer implementation and Conway's game of life.
- Learned numerous basic graphics techniques such as parallax mapping.
- Learned the basics of Unity's shader language.
