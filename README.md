Hi, I'm Garrett and I'm a technical artist/graphics developer. 

Let me show you what you've been missing.

ðŸ’¬ Now:
- Implementing extended difference of gaussians for advanced image stylization.

ðŸ’­ Later:
- Look into weather effects.
- Explore compute particle systems for Unity.
- Implement all currently relevant anti aliasing techniques. 
- Try and make a real time pixel sorting shader.
- Prototype grainy real time ray tracing as the main aesthetic of a horror game.

ðŸ’¤ Previously:
- Created a [suite of shaders](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/AcerolaFX) for GShade to improve the visuals of Final Fantasy XIV.
- Implemented the basic, generalized, and anisotropic Kuwahara Filters to make images look like oil paintings.
