Hi, I'm Garrett and I'm a technical artist/graphics developer. 

Let me show you what you've been missing.

ðŸ’¬ Now:
- Recreating Elden Ring's star shard particles.

ðŸ’­ Later:
- Look into weather effects.
- Texture hack SSBM and create custom skins.

ðŸ’¤ Previously:
- Optimized [GPU instanced grass](https://youtu.be/PNvlqsXdQic) with compute shader frustum culling and LOD as well as chunking.
- Recreated Loop Hero's [CRT Shader](https://youtu.be/aWdySZ0BtJs).
